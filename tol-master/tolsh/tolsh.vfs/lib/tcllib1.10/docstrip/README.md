# README - docstrip Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `docstrip` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module appears to be related to the concept of "docstripping," likely inspired by the utility of the same name used with LaTeX. It probably involves extracting documentation or code sections from source files based on specific tags or directives.

## Contents

### Files

- `docstrip.tcl`: The core implementation of the docstrip functionality.
- `docstrip_util.tcl`: Utility procedures supporting the main `docstrip` logic.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is likely to provide a Tcl-based tool for literate programming or selective code/documentation extraction. It might allow developers to maintain source files containing both code and extensive documentation, and then use `docstrip` to generate either runnable code files (stripping documentation) or documentation files (stripping code or extracting documentation blocks) based on directives within the source.
