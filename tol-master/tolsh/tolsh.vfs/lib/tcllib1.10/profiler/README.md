# README - profiler Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `profiler` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides code execution profiling capabilities for Tcl scripts.

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to help developers analyze the performance of their Tcl code. It allows measuring the time spent executing individual procedures (procs) or specific code sections. By running a script under the profiler, developers can identify bottlenecks and optimize the parts of their code that consume the most execution time.
