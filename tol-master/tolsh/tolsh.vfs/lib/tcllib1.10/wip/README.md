# WIP Package (Work In Progress?)

This directory contains the Tcllib `wip` package.

## Files

*   `wip.tcl`, `wip2.tcl`: Core implementation files. The name "wip" strongly suggests these modules contain experimental or incomplete functionality that might be under development or subject to change.
*   `pkgIndex.tcl`: The package index file for loading the `wip` package(s).

## Purpose

The specific purpose is unclear without examining the code, but it likely houses features that were not considered stable or finalized at the time Tcllib 1.10 was released. Caution should be exercised when using components from this directory as their APIs or behavior might change in future versions.

## Usage

Usage depends entirely on the functionality implemented within `wip.tcl` and `wip2.tcl`. Examination of the source code is required.

```tcl
package require wip
# Or potentially package require wip::some_sub_package

# --- Usage depends on specific commands defined in wip.tcl/wip2.tcl --- 
```
