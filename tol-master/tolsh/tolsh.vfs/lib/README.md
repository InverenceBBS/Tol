# TolSH Starkit Tcl Libraries (`tol-master/tolsh/tolsh.vfs/lib/`)

## Overview

This directory, part of the TolSH Starkit Virtual File System (VFS), contains the various Tcl library modules used by the TolSH application (`tol-master/tolsh/tolsh.vfs/main.tcl`).

## Contents

- **`app-tolsh/`:** Contains Tcl scripts implementing the core application logic specific to TolSH. This likely includes command parsing, interaction loops, and managing the interface with the TOL engine.
- **`base64/`:** A standard Tcl library for Base64 encoding and decoding.
- **`tcllib1.10/`:** Contains modules from **TclLib version 1.10**, a standard collection of utility packages for Tcl.
- **`tequila/`:** Purpose unclear from the name; it might be a testing framework, a specific Tcl extension, or another utility library.
- **`tlogger/`:** A Tcl library providing logging capabilities for the TolSH application.
- **`tolcomm/`:** Tcl scripts likely responsible for handling communication. This could be the primary interface layer talking to the TolTcl binding, or it might involve network communication for remote TOL sessions.

## Purpose

These Tcl libraries provide the necessary functionality for the TolSH application, including core logic, standard utilities (TclLib, base64), logging, and communication with the TOL backend.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** Tcl.
- **Packaging:** Bundled within the TolSH Starkit (`tol-master/tolsh/sdx.kit`).
