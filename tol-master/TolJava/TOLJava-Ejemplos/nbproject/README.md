# NetBeans Project Files (Examples) (`tol-master/TolJava/TOLJava-Ejemplos/nbproject/`)

## Overview

This directory contains project configuration files specifically for the **NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**. These files are used by NetBeans to manage the **TolJava Examples** project located in the parent directory (`tol-master/TolJava/TOLJava-Ejemplos/`).

## Contents

- **`project.xml`, `project.properties`:** Define project metadata, source/test directories, classpath (including the dependency on the core `TolJava.jar`), and other project-level settings for the examples.
- **`build-impl.xml`:** Contains NetBeans-generated Ant build script logic for the examples project, often extending the main `build.xml` in the parent directory.
- **`genfiles.properties`:** Properties related to generated files.
- **`private/`:** Contains user-specific NetBeans settings or metadata for the examples project.

## Purpose

These files enable developers using the NetBeans IDE to easily open, build, run, and debug the TolJava example code. They store the IDE-specific configuration needed for managing the example projects.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** NetBeans IDE project format, Apache Ant.
- **Usage:** Used automatically by the NetBeans IDE when working with the TolJava examples project.
