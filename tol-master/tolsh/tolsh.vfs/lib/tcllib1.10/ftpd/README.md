## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to allow Tcl applications to act as an FTP server. It listens for incoming FTP connections, handles user authentication (potentially via pluggable backends), and processes standard FTP commands (like USER, PASS, CWD, LIST, RETR, STOR, etc.) to allow clients to navigate directories and transfer files.
