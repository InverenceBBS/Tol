# uevent Package

This directory contains the Tcllib `uevent` package.

## Files

*   `uevent.tcl`: The core implementation of the `uevent` functionality. The name suggests it might be related to user events, micro-events, or possibly unique events.
*   `pkgIndex.tcl`: The package index file for loading the `uevent` package.

## Purpose

Without further context or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear. It likely provides a custom event handling or notification mechanism within Tcl applications, potentially for simpler event types than Tcl's built-in event loop or for specific inter-component communication.

## Usage

```tcl
package require uevent

# Conceptual usage - requires specific knowledge of the package
# uevent::bind eventName script
# uevent::trigger eventName ?args...?
```

Refer to `uevent.tcl` for implementation details.
