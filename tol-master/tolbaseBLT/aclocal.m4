# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

# Rely on autoconf to set up CDPATH properly.

#	Try to determine the proper flags to pass to the compiler
#	for building shared libraries and other such nonsense.
#
# Arguments:

#
# Results:
#
#	Defines the following vars:
#
#       DL_OBJS -       Name of the object file that implements dynamic
#                       loading for Tcl on this system.
#       DL_LIBS -       Library file(s) to include in tclsh and other base
#                       applications in order for the "load" command to work.
#       LDFLAGS -      Flags to pass to the compiler when linking object
#                       files into an executable application binary such
#                       as tclsh.
#       LD_SEARCH_FLAGS-Flags to pass to ld, such as "-R /usr/local/tcl/lib",
#                       that tell the run-time dynamic linker where to look
#                       for shared libraries such as libtcl.so.  Depends on
#                       the variable LIB_RUNTIME_DIR in the Makefile.
#       SHLIB_CFLAGS -  Flags to pass to cc when compiling the components
#                       of a shared library (may request position-independent
#                       code, among other things).
#       SHLIB_LD -      Base command to use for combining object files
#                       into a shared library.
#       SHLIB_LD_LIBS - Dependent libraries for the linker to scan when
#                       creating shared libraries.  This symbol typically
#                       goes at the end of the "ld" commands that build
#                       shared libraries. The value of the symbol is
#                       "${LIBS}" if all of the dependent libraries should
#                       be specified when creating a shared library.  If
#                       dependent libraries should not be specified (as on
#                       SunOS 4.x, where they cause the link to fail, or in
#                       general if Tcl and Tk aren't themselves shared
#                       libraries), then this symbol has an empty string
#                       as its value.
#       SHLIB_SUFFIX -  Suffix to use for the names of dynamically loadable
#                       extensions.  An empty string means we don't know how
#                       to use shared libraries on this platform.
#       TCL_LIB_FILE -  Name of the file that contains the Tcl library, such
#                       as libtcl7.8.so or libtcl7.8.a.
#       TCL_LIB_SUFFIX -Specifies everything that comes after the "libtcl"
#                       in the shared library name, using the $VERSION variable
#                       to put the version in the right place.  This is used
#                       by platforms that need non-standard library names.
#                       Examples:  ${VERSION}.so.1.1 on NetBSD, since it needs
#                       to have a version after the .so, and ${VERSION}.a
#                       on AIX, since the Tcl shared library needs to have
#                       a .a extension whereas shared objects for loadable
#                       extensions have a .so extension.  Defaults to
#                       ${VERSION}${SHLIB_SUFFIX}.
#       TCL_NEEDS_EXP_FILE -
#                       1 means that an export file is needed to link to a
#                       shared library.
#       TCL_EXP_FILE -  The name of the installed export / import file which
#                       should be used to link to the Tcl shared library.
#                       Empty if Tcl is unshared.
#       TCL_BUILD_EXP_FILE -
#                       The name of the built export / import file which
#                       should be used to link to the Tcl shared library.
#                       Empty if Tcl is unshared.
#	CFLAGS_DEBUG -
