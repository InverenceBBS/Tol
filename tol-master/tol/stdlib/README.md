# TOL Standard Library (`tol-master/tol/stdlib/`)

## Overview

This directory contains the source code for the **TOL Standard Library**. This library provides a collection of essential functions, data types, and modules readily available to developers programming in the TOL language. A significant portion of the standard library appears to be implemented in TOL itself (`.tol` files).

## Code Functionality

The code defines the standard set of tools available within the TOL environment:
- **Core Initialization:** Files like `_init_stdlib.tol` and `_tolcore.tol` likely handle the bootstrapping and loading of the standard library components when the TOL interpreter starts.
- **Functional Modules:** Subdirectories organize library functions by domain:
    - `arima/`: Likely contains functions related to ARIMA time series modeling.
    - `system/`: Probably provides functions for interacting with the operating system (e.g., file access, environment variables).
    - `various/`: A collection of miscellaneous utility functions (e.g., string manipulation, math utilities, data structure operations).
- **Package System:** Directories like `TolPackage/`, `DefaultPackages/`, and `TolConfigManager/` suggest an internal package management system for organizing, loading, and possibly configuring standard library modules. TOL code likely uses this system to import functionality (e.g., `Include("module_name")` or similar).
- **Build Integration:** `Makefile.am` indicates that these TOL source files are part of the overall build process, likely installed to a location where the TOL interpreter can find them.

## Potential API Functionality (TOL Language Level)

The "API" here refers to the functions and modules available *within* the TOL language:
- **Built-in Functions:** A wide range of functions callable directly in TOL scripts (e.g., mathematical operations, string functions, type conversions).
- **Modules/Packages:** Collections of related functions and data types accessed via TOL's package loading mechanism (e.g., `Include` statements). Examples based on directory structure:
    - `arima::Function(...)`
    - `system::FileOpen(...)`
    - `various::UtilityFunc(...)`
- **Standard Data Types:** Definitions or extensions of core TOL data types, possibly including specialized time series objects.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** Primarily TOL (`.tol`), potentially with some supporting C/C++ code in the core interpreter (`tol-master/tol/`).
- **Build:** Standard library files are likely installed during the main TOL build process (see `Makefile.am`).
