# TolTcl OTAN Build/Packaging (`tol-master/toltcl/OTAN/`)

## Overview

This directory contains platform-specific resources and a TOL build script potentially related to a specialized build or packaging process for the **TolTcl** binding layer, internally referred to as "OTAN".

## Contents

- **Platform-Specific Resources:**
    - `ToltclLinux32/`: Contains files or scripts tailored for building or packaging TolTcl for 32-bit Linux environments.
    - `ToltclWin32/`: Contains files or scripts tailored for building or packaging TolTcl for 32-bit Windows environments.
- **Build Automation:**
    - `_build.tol`: A script written in the TOL language. This script likely automates parts of the build or packaging process defined within this OTAN directory, possibly generating platform-specific artifacts or coordinating other build tools.

## Purpose

The exact purpose of the "OTAN" process isn't fully clear from the contents, but it appears to be a specialized build or packaging system for TolTcl targeting specific 32-bit platforms (Linux, Windows). It utilizes the TOL language itself (`_build.tol`) for automation, complementing the main CMake and Autotools build configurations found in the parent directory.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** TOL scripting, potentially platform-specific build tools or scripts within subdirectories.
- **Usage:** Likely used internally by developers for creating specific TolTcl builds or packages.
