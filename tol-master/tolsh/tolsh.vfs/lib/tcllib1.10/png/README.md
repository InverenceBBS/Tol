# README - png Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `png` module from Tcllib 1.10, within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides utilities for reading and possibly writing Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image files.

## Contents

### Files

- `png.tcl`: The core implementation for handling PNG files.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to allow Tcl applications to interact with PNG image data. This typically involves reading PNG files, accessing metadata (like dimensions, color type, bit depth), and potentially decoding the image data for use with Tk photo images or other image processing tasks. It might also support creating or modifying PNG files.
