# README - transfer Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `transfer` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module likely provides a framework and components for handling data transfer operations, possibly asynchronously or between different types of endpoints.

## Contents

### Files

- `transmitter.tcl`: Component responsible for sending data.
- `receiver.tcl`: Component responsible for receiving data.
- `dsource.tcl`: Defines a data source for a transfer operation.
- `ddest.tcl`: Defines a data destination for a transfer operation.
- `tqueue.tcl`: Likely implements a transfer queue for managing multiple or asynchronous transfers.
- `copyops.tcl`: Contains procedures related to the copy operations during transfer.
- `connect.tcl`: Utilities for establishing connections needed for transfers.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the `transfer` module and its various components.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to provide a higher-level abstraction for transferring data between sources and destinations in Tcl. This could involve transferring data between files, sockets, or other channels, potentially managing the process asynchronously using queues and transmitter/receiver components.
