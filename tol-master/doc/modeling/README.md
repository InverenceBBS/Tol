# TOL Modeling Documentation & Papers (`tol-master/doc/modeling/`)

## Overview

This directory contains documentation, examples, and academic papers related to performing statistical modeling and quantitative analysis using the TOL language and its associated packages.

## Contents

- **Specific Model Documentation/Examples (Subdirectories):**
    - `AIA/`
    - `ARIMA_Estimate/`: Examples or notes on ARIMA model estimation.
    - `BSR/`: Bayesian Structural Regression examples or documentation.
    - `BVAR/`: Bayesian Vector Autoregression examples or documentation.
    - `MultiTryMetropolis/`: Examples related to the Multi-Try Metropolis MCMC algorithm.
- **Papers and Technical Documents (PDF/ODT):**
    - `CLR.pdf`: Likely discusses Component Local Regression.
    - `Extensi√≥n de los modelos multiplicativos.*`: Paper/document on extending multiplicative models (Spanish).
    - `GibbsMA1.nb.pdf`: Possibly output from a notebook demonstrating Gibbs sampling for an MA(1) model.
    - `MCMC_convergence_diagnosis_with_CODA.pdf`: Paper or guide on using CODA for MCMC convergence diagnostics.
    - `best95coda.pdf`: Output or documentation related to analyzing MCMC results with CODA.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a resource hub for users interested in applying TOL to specific statistical modeling tasks. It provides theoretical background (papers), practical examples (subdirectories), and guides for various quantitative techniques.
