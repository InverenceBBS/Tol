# CPack Configuration Files (`tol-master/cpack/`)

## Overview

This directory contains configuration files and script templates used by **CPack**, the cross-platform software packaging tool integrated with CMake. These files help define how TOL packages (e.g., RPMs, DEBs, NSIS installers) are generated.

## Contents

- **`rpm_post_install.sh.in`:** A template for a shell script (`.sh`) designed to be executed on the target system *after* a TOL RPM package is installed.
    - The `.in` extension indicates that CMake likely processes this file (e.g., using `configure_file`) to substitute variables (like installation paths) before including it in the RPM package specification.
    - This script might perform tasks such as running `ldconfig` to update the shared library cache, creating symbolic links, setting up initial configuration files, or other necessary post-installation steps specific to RPM-based Linux distributions.

## Purpose

The files in this directory allow customization of the packages generated by CPack for different platforms and package formats. They enable platform-specific actions (like post-installation steps for RPMs) to be included in the generated packages, ensuring a smoother installation experience for users. This works in conjunction with the CPack settings defined in the main `CMakeLists.txt` and `CPackOptions.cmake.in`.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** CPack (CMake Packaging), Shell scripting.
- **Usage:** Used internally by the CMake/CPack packaging process.
