# BSR NonLinearFilter Tests

## Overview

This directory contains tests for applying non-linear filtering techniques, likely within a state-space or Bayesian context, to data potentially represented using TOL's BSR format.

## Contents

*   `_DeltaPrior.tol`: Tests involving a Delta prior, often used in Bayesian analysis.
*   `_LogAditiveEffect.tol`: Tests related to models with log-additive effects.
*   `_PubAdStock_ExpBetaDelta.tol`: Tests for a specific model, possibly related to advertising stock (`PubAdStock`) using Exponential, Beta, and Delta components or distributions.

## Purpose

To verify the implementation and application of specific non-linear filtering algorithms and models (possibly Bayesian state-space models) within TOL, potentially interacting with BSR data.
