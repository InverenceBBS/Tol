# WebTOLJavaDEMO Server Source Code (`tol-master/TolJava/WebTOLJavaDEMO/src/`)

## Overview

This directory contains the server-side source code and configuration files for the **WebTOLJavaDEMO** web application.

## Contents

- **`java/`:** Contains the Java source code (`.java` files), organized by package. This includes the backend logic for the web application, such as:
    - Java Servlets or framework controllers handling HTTP requests.
    - Business logic classes that use the TolJava API to interact with the TOL engine.
    - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or other data handling classes.
    - Possibly JavaServer Faces (JSF) Managed Beans if JSF is used.
- **`conf/`:** Contains application configuration files that are not Java code. This might include:
    - Property files (`.properties`).
    - XML configuration files for frameworks (e.g., dependency injection, ORM).
    - Other non-code resources loaded by the application at runtime.

## Purpose

This code implements the server-side logic of the web demo, demonstrating how to call the TolJava API from within a Java web application context to process requests and generate responses.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** Java.
- **Technology:** Java Servlets, possibly JSF or other web frameworks.
- **Build:** Compiled and included in the `.war` file generated by the Ant script (`build.xml`) in the parent directory.
