# BSR Generator Tests

## Overview

This directory contains tests related to generating data, likely in BSR format or for use in BSR-related tests, possibly for non-linear filtering models.

## Contents

*   `generator.tol`: The main script for data generation tests.
*   `input.tol`: Defines input data structures or parameters for generation.
*   `nonLinFltInp.tol`: Generates input data specifically for non-linear filter tests.
*   `nonLinFltOut.tol`: Defines expected output data for non-linear filter tests, likely used for comparison.
*   `obsNode.tol`: Generates or defines observation nodes, possibly within a graphical model context.
*   `transfun.tol`: Defines or tests transition functions, likely for state-space models used in non-linear filtering.

## Purpose

To verify the correct generation of test data, inputs, and expected outputs for BSR and related (e.g., non-linear filtering) test scenarios.
