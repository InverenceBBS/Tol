# ARIMA Missing Data Tests

## Overview

This directory contains tests focusing on handling missing data within ARIMA models in TOL.

## Contents

*   `MissingEstimation.tol`: A test script specifically designed to verify the estimation of ARIMA models when the time series contains missing observations.

## Purpose

To ensure that TOL's ARIMA procedures can correctly handle gaps in the input data, likely using appropriate statistical techniques (e.g., Kalman filter, interpolation methods) during estimation.
