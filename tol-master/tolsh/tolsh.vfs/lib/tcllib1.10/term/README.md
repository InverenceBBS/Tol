# README - term Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `term` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides tools for interacting with and controlling terminal devices, including handling ANSI escape codes and creating simple terminal-based user interfaces.

## Contents

### Files

- `term.tcl`: Possibly the main package entry point or common definitions.
- `bind.tcl`: Utilities for binding keys or events in a terminal context.
- `imenu.tcl`: Implementation of an interactive menu system for the terminal.
- `ipager.tcl`: Implementation of an interactive pager (like `less` or `more`) for the terminal.
- `receive.tcl`: Procedures for receiving data or handling input from the terminal.
- `send.tcl`: Procedures for sending data or control sequences to the terminal.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the `term` module and its sub-packages/components (like `term::ansi`).

### Subdirectories

- `ansi/`: Contains modules specifically for handling ANSI terminal control sequences (colors, cursor movement, etc.).

## Purpose

The purpose of the `term` module is to enable Tcl applications to create more sophisticated command-line interfaces (CLIs) or text-based user interfaces (TUIs). It provides abstractions for common terminal operations, including handling input, output, control codes (via the `ansi` subdirectory), and building interactive elements like menus and pagers.
