# README - multiplexer Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `multiplexer` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module likely provides tools for managing multiple I/O channels or event sources concurrently.

## Contents

### Files

- `multiplexer.tcl`: The core implementation of the multiplexer functionality.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is probably to simplify handling multiple simultaneous connections or data streams in Tcl applications. It might abstract lower-level event loop details (like `fileevent`) or provide a higher-level framework for managing I/O multiplexing, useful in network servers or other applications dealing with concurrent I/O.
