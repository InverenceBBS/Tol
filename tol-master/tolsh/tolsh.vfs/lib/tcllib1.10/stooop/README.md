# README - stooop Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `stooop` (Simple Tcl Only Object Oriented Programming) module from Tcllib 1.10, integrated within the `tolsh` VFS. It provides a basic object-oriented programming system implemented purely in Tcl.

## Contents

### Files

- `stooop.tcl`: The core implementation of the STOOOP object system.
- `switched.tcl`: Likely related to method dispatch or switching behavior within STOOOP.
- `xifo.tcl`: Possibly related to object lifecycle, initialization (e.g., First In, First Out semantics for construction/destruction or method calls).
- `mkpkgidx.tcl`: A script to generate the package index file.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the `stooop` module and related components.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to offer a lightweight, pure-Tcl mechanism for object-oriented programming. It allows developers to define classes, create objects, and use inheritance and method calls without relying on external extensions or more complex OO systems like TclOO or Incr Tcl.
