# README - rcs Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `rcs` module from Tcllib 1.10, part of the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides an interface for interacting with the Revision Control System (RCS), an early version control system.

## Contents

### Files

- `rcs.tcl`: The core Tcl implementation providing functions to parse RCS files or potentially interact with RCS command-line tools.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to allow Tcl applications to read information from RCS files (often ending in `,v`). This might involve extracting revision history, logs, specific versions of a file, or other metadata managed by RCS. It's less likely to provide full check-in/check-out capabilities but rather focuses on parsing existing RCS data.
