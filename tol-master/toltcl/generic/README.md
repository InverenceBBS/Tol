# TolTcl Binding Implementation (`tol-master/toltcl/generic/`)

## Overview

This directory contains the core C and C++ source code that implements the **TolTcl binding layer**. This code bridges the Tcl scripting environment with the underlying C++ TOL engine, allowing Tcl scripts to control and interact with TOL.

## Code Functionality

- **Main Tcl Command Implementations (`toltcl.c`):** Defines the C functions that are registered as new commands within the Tcl interpreter (typically in a `tol::` namespace). These functions parse Tcl command arguments and invoke corresponding actions in the TOL C++ engine. Includes the package initialization function (e.g., `Toltcl_Init`).
- **TOL Object/Data Handling (C++):** Several C++ files manage the interaction with specific TOL data structures:
    - `tolaccess.cpp`: General functions for accessing and manipulating TOL objects from Tcl.
    - `toltableset.cpp`: Handles conversion and interaction logic for TOL `Table` and `Set` objects.
    - `tolsergrp.cpp`: Handles conversion and interaction logic for TOL `Serie` (time series) objects.
    - `toltime.cpp`: Handles conversion and interaction logic for TOL time/date objects (using the `tai` library).
    These files bridge the Tcl C API (e.g., `Tcl_Obj*`) with the TOL C++ object model.
- **Internal Utilities (C++/C):**
    - `tclutils.cpp`/`.h`: Helper functions for working with the Tcl C API.
    - `pool.cpp`/`.h`: Possibly a custom memory pool or resource management utility for the binding.
    - `crash.c`/`.h`: Crash handling/reporting specific to the binding.
    - `tolsh.c`: Low-level C functions potentially used by the `tolsh` utility.
- **Headers (`toltcl.h`, `toltclInt.h`, `tt_common.h`):** Define public and internal interfaces, structures, and common definitions for the TolTcl binding code.
- **Build Integration (`CMakeLists.txt`):** CMake script defining how to compile this C/C++ code and link it against Tcl libraries and the core TOL library (`tollib`) to produce the final TolTcl shared library (`toltcl.so`/`.dll`).

## Purpose

This directory contains the essential C/C++ implementation of the TolTcl binding. It enables Tcl-based applications (like Tolbase and TolSH) to embed and control the TOL interpreter, execute TOL code, and exchange data between the Tcl and TOL environments.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** C, C++.
- **Technology:** Tcl C API, C++ (TOL internal API).
- **Build:** Compiled into a shared library loadable by Tcl.
