# TOL Language Runtime & Semantics (`tol-master/tol/lang/`)

## Overview

This directory contains core C++ code responsible for implementing the runtime behavior and semantics of the TOL language. It likely handles the execution of TOL code structures (produced by the parser) and may also include support for internationalization/localization.

## Code Functionality

- **Runtime Engine (`language.cpp`, `tol_blanguag.h`):** This core component likely implements:
    - The evaluation logic for the TOL Abstract Syntax Tree (or other intermediate representation) generated by the parser (`bparser/`).
    - Execution of TOL statements, expressions, and control flow structures (loops, conditionals).
    - Implementation of built-in functions and operators defined by the TOL language standard.
    - Management of runtime scope, namespaces, and variable lookup.
    - Handling of runtime errors and exceptions.
    - Potential support for internationalization (i18n) / localization (l10n), such as loading translated messages or handling locale-specific formatting, suggested by the directory name "lang".
- **Function Exporting (`exportfu.cpp`, `tol_exportfu.h`):** Code related to mechanisms for exporting functions, possibly for making internal C++ functions available to TOL scripts or defining how TOL functions are exposed.
- **Build System Integration (`CMakeLists.txt`, `Jamfile`, `Makefile.am`):** Compiles this runtime logic and links it into the core TOL library/interpreter.

## Purpose

This module forms a critical part of the TOL interpreter, bridging the gap between the parsed code structure (`bparser`) and the actual execution. It defines *what* TOL code *does* when it runs. It manages the runtime state, executes operations, calls functions (including those implemented in C++ like in `bmath` or `bbasic`), and potentially adapts behavior based on language/locale settings.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** C++.
- **Build:** Compiled as part of the main `tol` library/executable.
