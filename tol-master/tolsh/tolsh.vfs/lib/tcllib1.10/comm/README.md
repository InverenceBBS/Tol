# README - comm Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `comm` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism, likely enabling message passing or remote procedure calls between different Tcl processes or potentially between Tcl and other languages.

## Contents

### Files

- `comm.tcl`: The core implementation of the `comm` IPC framework.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories
