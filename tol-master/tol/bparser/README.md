# TOL Language Parser (`tol-master/tol/bparser/`)

## Overview

This directory contains the C++ source code for the **parser** and **lexical analyzer (scanner)** for the TOL language. It is responsible for reading TOL source code and converting it into an internal representation suitable for interpretation.

## Code Functionality

- **Lexical Analysis (Scanning):**
    - `scn.cpp` / `tol_bscanner.h`: Implement the scanner, which reads the raw TOL code (from files or strings).
    - `tok.cpp` / `tol_btoken.h`: Define token types (e.g., `KEYWORD`, `IDENTIFIER`, `NUMBER`, `OPERATOR`) and manage the token stream generated by the scanner. The scanner breaks the input text into these fundamental units based on lexical rules.
- **Syntactic Analysis (Parsing):**
    - `par.cpp` / `tol_bparser.h`: Implement the parser, which consumes the token stream produced by the scanner. It checks if the sequence of tokens conforms to the grammatical rules of the TOL language (syntax) and typically builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or another intermediate representation that captures the structure of the code.
- **Input Handling:**
    - `fil.cpp` / `tol_bfilter.h`: Possibly handles input filtering, managing input streams, or preprocessing steps like handling include directives before the code reaches the scanner/parser.
- **Build System Integration:** `CMakeLists.txt`, `Jamfile`, and `Makefile.am` compile these parser components and link them into the core TOL library/interpreter.

## Purpose

The `bparser` module is a fundamental part of the TOL interpreter. It performs the crucial first steps in understanding TOL code:
1.  **Scanning:** Breaking the character stream into meaningful tokens.
2.  **Parsing:** Organizing the tokens into a structured representation (like an AST) based on the language's grammar, verifying syntactic correctness.
The output of the parser (the AST or intermediate representation) is then used by the TOL evaluation engine to actually execute the code.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** C++.
- **Technology:** Compiler construction techniques (lexical analysis, parsing). Might use parser generator tools internally, or be hand-written.
- **Build:** Compiled as part of the main `tol` library/executable.
