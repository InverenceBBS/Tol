# Third-Party Libraries (`tol-master/tolbaseBLT/ThirdParty/`)

## Overview

This directory collects external Tcl/Tk packages and other dependencies needed
by the tolbaseBLT widget toolkit. Bundling them here simplifies installation on
systems where the packages might not be available.

## Contents

The exact libraries vary, but may include components like **MkWidgets** or
additional Tk extensions that the BLT widgets rely on.

## Purpose

These third-party modules are distributed alongside tolbaseBLT so end users do
not need to fetch them separately when building or installing Tolbase.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** Tcl/Tk extensions and helper libraries.
- **Usage:** Packaged and installed as part of the tolbaseBLT build process.
