# Counter Package

This directory contains the Tcllib `counter` package.

## Files

*   `counter.tcl`: The core implementation of the counter functionality. Based on its size, it likely provides advanced counter features, potentially including persistent counters, named counters, or counters with specific behaviors.
*   `pkgIndex.tcl`: The package index file for loading the `counter` package.

## Usage

This package provides procedures for creating and manipulating counters.

```tcl
package require counter

# Example Usage (Conceptual - Refer to counter.tcl or Tcllib documentation)

# Create or increment a counter
# counter::inc counterName ?incrementValue?

# Get the value of a counter
# set value [counter::get counterName]

# Reset a counter
# counter::reset counterName
```

This likely offers more robust counter management than simple Tcl variables, possibly for tracking events, generating unique IDs, or statistics gathering.
