# Archive Packing Utilities (`tol-master/tol/PackArchive/`)

## Overview

This directory contains C++ components for creating file archives, with a specific implementation provided for the ZIP archive format.

## Code Functionality

- **Archiving Logic (`PackArchive.cpp`, `tol_PackArchive.h`):** Provides the general interface or base classes for creating archives and adding files to them.
- **ZIP Implementation (`StoreZipArchive.cpp`, `tol_StoreZipArchive.h`):** Contains the specific C++ code for creating and writing files into ZIP archives. This likely involves using a third-party ZIP library (like zlib or minizip) or implementing the ZIP format directly.
- **Build System Integration (`CMakeLists.txt`, `Jamfile`, `Makefile.am`):** Ensures this archiving utility code is compiled and linked as part of the main TOL library or relevant tools.

## Purpose

This component provides the TOL system (either the core interpreter or related tools) with the capability to bundle multiple files into a single archive file, specifically supporting the common ZIP format. This could be used for:
- Packaging TOL projects or libraries.
- Storing results or datasets.
- Implementing the ZIP backend for the OIS serialization system (`tol-master/tol/OIS/`).
- Distributing TOL extensions or packages.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** C++.
- **Technology:** ZIP archive format, possibly requires a ZIP library dependency (e.g., zlib).
- **Build:** Compiled as part of the main `tol` library/executable or related tools.
