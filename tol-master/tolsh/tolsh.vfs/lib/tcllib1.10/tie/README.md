# README - tie Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `tie` module from Tcllib 1.10, within the `tolsh` VFS. Inspired by Perl's `tie` mechanism, this module likely allows associating Tcl variables (arrays) with custom data sources or backends, intercepting read/write operations.

## Contents

### Files

- `tie.tcl`: The core implementation of the `tie` framework.
- `tie_array.tcl`: Base implementation for tying standard Tcl arrays.
- `tie_rarray.tcl`: Implementation for tying read-only arrays.
- `tie_file.tcl`: Implementation for tying an array to the lines of a file.
- `tie_growfile.tcl`: Implementation for tying an array to a file that can grow (append-only access).
- `tie_dsource.tcl`: Tying to a data source object (possibly from the `transfer` package).
- `tie_log.tcl`: Implementation for logging array access via `tie`.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the `tie` module and its specific implementations.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to provide a powerful mechanism for abstracting data access in Tcl. By "tying" a variable (typically an array) to a specific implementation, scripts can interact with the variable using standard array commands (`set`, `gets`, `array exists`, etc.), while the underlying operations are handled by the custom tied implementation (e.g., reading from a file, querying a database, accessing a remote resource).
