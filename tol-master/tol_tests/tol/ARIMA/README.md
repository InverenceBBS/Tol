# TOL ARIMA Tests

## Overview

This directory contains test suites for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model functionality within the TOL system.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

*   `GibbsARMA/`: Tests related to ARMA models using Gibbs sampling.
*   `Missing/`: Tests possibly handling missing data in ARIMA models.
*   `SimulArima/`: Tests related to simulating ARIMA processes.
*   `Stationarity/`: Tests for stationarity checks or transformations.
*   `mcmc/`: Tests related to general Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods applied to ARIMA/ARMA.

## Purpose

To verify the correctness and robustness of TOL's functions for estimating, simulating, and analyzing ARIMA models, including handling variations and specific techniques.
