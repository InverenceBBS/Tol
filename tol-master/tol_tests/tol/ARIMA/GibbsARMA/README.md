# GibbsARMA Tests

## Overview

This directory contains tests specifically for ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) models estimated or analyzed using Gibbs sampling techniques within TOL.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

*   `ARMS/`: Likely contains tests for a specific variation or implementation detail of ARMA with Gibbs Sampling (perhaps Adaptive Rejection Metropolis Sampling?).

## Purpose

To verify the implementation and results of using Gibbs sampling for ARMA model analysis in TOL.
