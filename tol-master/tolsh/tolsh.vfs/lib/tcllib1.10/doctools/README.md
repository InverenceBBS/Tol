# README - doctools Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory houses the `doctools` module from Tcllib 1.10, within the `tolsh` VFS. Doctools is a documentation generation system for Tcl, similar in concept to systems like Javadoc or Doxygen but tailored for Tcl's syntax and conventions. It processes source files containing special markup comments to generate documentation in various formats.

## Contents

### Files

- `doctools.tcl`: The core engine and procedures for the doctools system.
- `docidx.tcl`: Likely handles the generation of documentation indices.
- `doctoc.tcl`: Likely handles the generation of tables of contents.
- `api.tcl`, `api_idx.tcl`, `api_toc.tcl`: Components possibly related to generating API-specific documentation views, indices, and tables of contents.
- `checker.tcl`, `checker_idx.tcl`, `checker_toc.tcl`: Components possibly related to validating the documentation markup or structure.
- `changelog.tcl`: Procedures for processing or generating changelog information, perhaps from specific markup.
- `cvs.tcl`: Integration or utilities related to CVS (Concurrent Versions System) metadata, potentially for linking documentation to code versions.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the main `doctools` package and potentially related sub-packages or components.

### Subdirectories

- `mpformats/`: Contains multi-part formatters, allowing `doctools` to generate output in different formats (e.g., HTML, nroff, LaTeX).

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `doctools` module is to provide a standardized system for documenting Tcl code and generating user manuals or API references from source code comments. It defines a specific markup language to embed within Tcl scripts and offers tools to process this markup into various output formats via the plugins in `mpformats`.
