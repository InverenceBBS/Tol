# Tolbase Tcl Library (`tol-master/tolbase/lib/`)

## Overview

This directory contains the core Tcl script libraries that implement the functionality and user interface components of the Tolbase GUI application. These scripts define the widgets, procedures, and application logic.

## Contents

The directory is organized into modules, each residing in its own subdirectory:
- **`autoscroll/`:** Provides autoscrolling capabilities for widgets.
- **`byswidget/`:** Contains custom Tcl/Tk widgets developed specifically for Tolbase (indicated by the 'bys' prefix).
- **`markupparser/`, `markupviewer/`:** Implements parsing and viewing capabilities for a markup language used within Tolbase (e.g., for styled text or help).
- **`mimetex/`:** Likely integrates with `mimeTeX` to allow rendering of LaTeX mathematical formulas.
- **`mkWidgets1.3/`:** Appears to include or utilize the MkWidgets Tcl/Tk library (v1.3) for additional GUI elements.
- **`nbdbmanager/`, `notebookdb/`:** Tcl code possibly related to managing database interactions within a notebook interface.
- **`renderpane/`:** A custom widget for rendering specific types of content.
- **`rmtps_client/`:** Client code for interacting with a remote service ("rmtps").
- **`toltk/`:** Core Tcl procedures that interface between the Tolbase GUI elements and the underlying `TolTcl` binding (which communicates with the C++ TOL engine).
- **`trycatch/`:** Provides try/catch error handling constructs (potentially for older Tcl versions).
- **`wtree/`:** Implements or wraps a tree widget.

**Packaging:**
- `pkgIndex.tcl.in`: A template processed by the build system to create `pkgIndex.tcl`, which tells the Tcl interpreter which scripts to load for the Tolbase library package.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Manages the installation of these Tcl script files and the generation of `pkgIndex.tcl`.

## Purpose

This `lib/` directory forms the heart of the Tolbase GUI application, written in Tcl. It defines the application's structure, appearance, and behavior by providing reusable Tcl modules, custom widgets, and the logic to interact with the TOL interpreter via the `TolTcl` binding.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** Tcl/Tk.
- **Usage:** These scripts are automatically loaded by the Tcl interpreter when Tolbase starts or when the Tolbase package is required. They are installed to a Tcl library location by the build process.
