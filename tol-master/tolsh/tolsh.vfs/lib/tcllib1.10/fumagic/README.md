# README - fumagic Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `fumagic` (File Utility Magic?) module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module appears to be related to identifying file types based on their content ("magic numbers") or other heuristics, similar to the Unix `file` command.

## Contents

### Files

- `cfront.tcl`: Possibly a front-end component, potentially related to C code generation or interaction.
- `cgen.tcl`: Likely a code generator, perhaps generating C or Tcl code based on file type definitions.
- `filetypes.tcl`: Contains definitions or rules for identifying various file types based on magic numbers or patterns.
- `mimetypes.tcl`: Contains mappings or definitions related to MIME types, likely used in conjunction with file type identification.
- `rtcore.tcl`: A runtime core component for the `fumagic` system.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module and its components.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to provide Tcl applications with the ability to determine the type of a file by examining its contents, rather than relying solely on its extension. It uses a database of known patterns (`filetypes.tcl`) and can likely map these types to standard MIME types (`mimetypes.tcl`). Components like `cfront` and `cgen` might be used for building or optimizing the recognition engine.
