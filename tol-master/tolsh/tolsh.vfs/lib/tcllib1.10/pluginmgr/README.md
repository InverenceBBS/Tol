# README - pluginmgr Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `pluginmgr` (Plugin Manager) module from Tcllib 1.10, within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides a framework for managing plugins within a Tcl application.

## Contents

### Files

- `pluginmgr.tcl`: The core implementation of the plugin management system.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to offer a structured way for Tcl applications to discover, load, initialize, and potentially manage the lifecycle of plugins. This promotes modularity by allowing applications to be extended with new functionality without modifying the core codebase. It likely handles searching specified directories for plugin files and calling defined initialization procedures.
