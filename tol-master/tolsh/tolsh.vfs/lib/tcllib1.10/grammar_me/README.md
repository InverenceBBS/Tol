# README - grammar::me Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `grammar::me` (Machine Engine/Meta Engine?) module from Tcllib 1.10, within the `tolsh` VFS. This module appears to define and implement a virtual machine or execution engine, possibly used for executing grammars (like PEGs from `grammar::peg` or `page`) or other intermediate representations.

## Contents

### Files

- `me_cpu.tcl`: Defines the CPU or core execution logic for the virtual machine.
- `me_cpucore.tcl`: A more detailed or lower-level implementation of the CPU core.
- `me_tcl.tcl`: Provides an interface or bridge between the ME virtual machine and the Tcl interpreter environment.
- `me_util.tcl`: Utility functions supporting the ME implementation.
- `gasm.tcl`: A grammar assembler (`gasm`)? This might assemble a textual representation of ME instructions into bytecode for the virtual machine.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the `grammar::me` module and its components.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to provide a virtual machine environment tailored for tasks likely related to grammar processing or execution within Tcllib. It defines a set of instructions, an execution core (`me_cpu`, `me_cpucore`), and tools (`gasm`, `me_tcl`) to compile to and interact with this VM. This is often done for performance or to provide a more controlled execution environment compared to direct Tcl execution for certain tasks.
