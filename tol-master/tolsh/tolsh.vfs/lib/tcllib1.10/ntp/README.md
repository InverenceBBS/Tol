# README - ntp Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `ntp` (Network Time Protocol) module from Tcllib 1.10, specifically the `ntp::time` package, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides client functionality to query NTP servers for the current time.

## Contents

### Files

- `time.tcl`: The core implementation for the NTP client logic (`ntp::time` package).
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the `ntp::time` module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to allow Tcl applications to retrieve accurate time information from NTP servers over the network. This is useful for synchronizing clocks, timestamping events accurately, or any application requiring time more precise than the local system clock might provide.
