# ARIMA MCMC Tests

## Overview

This directory contains tests related to using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, specifically Metropolis-Hastings (MH), in the context of ARIMA/ARMA models within TOL.

## Contents

*   `generate.model.tol`: Script for generating model data, likely used as input for the MCMC tests.
*   `maxlh.tol`: Tests related to Maximum Likelihood estimation, perhaps for comparison or initialization for MCMC.
*   `mtrymh.cycle.tol`: A specific test or component related to cycles within a Metropolis-Hastings run.
*   `mtrymh.mcmc.tol`: The main MCMC test script using Metropolis-Hastings.
*   `mtrymh.tol`: Likely contains core functions or setup for the Metropolis-Hastings tests.

## Purpose

To verify the implementation and correctness of using MCMC techniques (specifically Metropolis-Hastings) for estimating parameters or analyzing properties of ARIMA/ARMA models in TOL.
