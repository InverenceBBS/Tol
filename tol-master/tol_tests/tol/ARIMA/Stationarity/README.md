# ARIMA Stationarity Tests

## Overview

This directory contains tests focusing on stationarity testing and related functions within the context of ARIMA models in TOL.

## Contents

*   `test_rand_stationary.tol`: Tests related to generating or checking random stationary processes.
*   `test_slice.tol`: Purpose unclear from name, might involve testing stationarity on slices of data or relate to a specific "slice" sampling method.
*   `test_stationarity_num_zones.tol`: Tests potentially related to identifying the number of stationary zones or segments within a time series.
*   `test_uniform_rand_stationary.tol`: Tests specifically for uniformly distributed random stationary processes.

## Purpose

To verify TOL's functionality for assessing the stationarity of time series, which is a crucial prerequisite for standard ARIMA modeling, and potentially for related data generation or analysis techniques.
