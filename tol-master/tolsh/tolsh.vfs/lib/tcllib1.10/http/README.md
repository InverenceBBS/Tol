# README - http Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `http` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This specific part seems to focus on HTTP client functionality, particularly proxy handling.

## Contents

### Files

- `autoproxy.tcl`: Implementation for automatic HTTP proxy detection and configuration, likely using environment variables or system settings.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module (or this specific part of it).

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module (or at least the `autoproxy.tcl` part) is to simplify HTTP requests in environments where a proxy server is required. It likely provides functions that automatically determine the correct proxy settings to use when making HTTP requests using Tcl's built-in `::http::geturl` or other HTTP client functionalities within Tcllib.
