# TolSH Tests (`tol-master/tolsh/tests/`)

## Overview

This directory contains test scripts and resources for verifying the functionality of the **TolSH** Starkit shell.

## Contents

- **`matprod/`:** A subdirectory containing tests specifically focused on matrix product (`matprod`) operations. This might include:
    - TOL scripts (`.tol`) performing matrix multiplications.
    - Scripts to verify the correctness of the results.
    - Potentially performance benchmarks for matrix operations within TolSH.

(Other subdirectories or test files might be added here to cover different aspects of TolSH functionality, such as command history, line editing, argument parsing, or interaction with the TolTcl binding.)

## Purpose

These tests ensure that the TolSH application works as expected, particularly concerning its ability to execute TOL code involving specific operations like matrix products. They help maintain the stability and correctness of the TolSH tool.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** TOL scripting language, possibly Tcl.
