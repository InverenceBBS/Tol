# README - fileutil Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `fileutil` module from Tcllib 1.10, part of the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides a collection of utility procedures for common file and directory operations, extending the built-in Tcl file commands.

## Contents

### Files

- `fileutil.tcl`: The main implementation file containing various file utility procedures.
- `multi.tcl`: Likely related to handling multiple files or operations simultaneously (possibly a sub-package).
- `multiop.tcl`: Contains procedures for performing operations on multiple files (e.g., copying, moving multiple files).
- `traverse.tcl`: Provides procedures for traversing directory hierarchies.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file, likely indexing `fileutil`, `fileutil::multiop`, and `fileutil::traverse`.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to offer a convenient set of tools for file system manipulation in Tcl. It includes functions for tasks like recursive directory traversal, multiple file operations (copying, deleting), finding files, touching files, and potentially more, simplifying common scripting tasks involving the file system.
