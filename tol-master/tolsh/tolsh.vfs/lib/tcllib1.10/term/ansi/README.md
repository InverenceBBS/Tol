# README - term::ansi Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains components of the `term::ansi` submodule within Tcllib 1.10's `term` package, located in the `tolsh` VFS. This submodule specifically focuses on handling ANSI escape sequences for terminal control.

## Contents

### Files

- `code.tcl`: Likely defines constants or procedures related to basic ANSI codes (e.g., colors, attributes).
- `ctrlunix.tcl`: Contains definitions or handling logic for Unix-specific ANSI control sequences or terminal interactions.
- `send.tcl`: Procedures specifically for sending ANSI escape sequences to the terminal.

### Subdirectories

- `code/`: Contains further breakdown or categorization of ANSI codes (e.g., color codes, cursor movement codes).

## Purpose

The purpose of this submodule is to provide a structured way to generate and send ANSI escape codes to control terminal appearance and behavior. This includes setting text colors, background colors, text attributes (bold, underline), moving the cursor, clearing the screen, etc., allowing Tcl applications to create richer terminal output.
