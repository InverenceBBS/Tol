# README - pop3d Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `pop3d` module from Tcllib 1.10, within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides an implementation of a POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) server daemon.

## Contents

### Files

- `pop3d.tcl`: The core implementation of the POP3 server logic.
- `pop3d_dbox.tcl`: A backend implementation for `pop3d` that likely uses a simple directory/file-based mailbox format (`dbox`).
- `pop3d_udb.tcl`: A backend implementation for `pop3d` that uses a user database (`udb`) for authentication and possibly mailbox location.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the `pop3d` module and its backends.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to allow Tcl applications to act as a POP3 server. It listens for incoming connections from mail clients, handles user authentication (using pluggable backends like `_dbox` or `_udb`), and processes POP3 commands (like USER, PASS, STAT, LIST, RETR, DELE, QUIT) to allow clients to retrieve emails from a mailbox.
