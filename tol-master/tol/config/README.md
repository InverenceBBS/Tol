# Autotools Build System Support (`tol-master/tol/config/`)

## Overview

This directory contains standard helper scripts and M4 macro files used by the GNU Autotools build system (`autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`) within the TOL project. These files provide portability and core functionality for the `./configure` and `make` process.

## Contents

- **Autoconf Macros (`acinclude.m4`, `bys.m4`):** These files contain M4 macro definitions used by `autoconf` when generating the `configure` script from `configure.in`. They likely include project-specific checks for libraries, headers, or features, as well as potentially custom macros (`bys.m4`).
- **Standard Autotools Helper Scripts:** These are widely used scripts, typically distributed with Autotools or copied into projects:
    - `config.guess`, `config.sub`: Determine and validate the target system type.
    - `compile`, `depcomp`: Compiler wrappers for dependency tracking.
    - `install-sh`, `mkinstalldirs`: Portable installation utilities.
    - `ltmain.sh`: Core script for GNU Libtool, enabling portable shared library creation.
    - `missing`: Provides stubs for potentially missing standard Unix utilities.

## Purpose

These scripts and macros form the backbone of the Autotools build configuration for TOL. They allow the `configure` script (generated by `autoconf`) to:
- Detect system features, libraries, and tools.
- Adapt the build process to the specific environment.
- Ensure that `make` commands correctly compile and link the software.
- Handle the complexities of creating and installing shared libraries portably using Libtool.
- Provide necessary helper utilities for compilation and installation.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** GNU Autotools (Autoconf, Automake, Libtool), M4 macro language, Shell scripting.
- **Usage:** Used internally by the `./configure && make` process. Developers typically don't interact with these files directly unless modifying the Autotools build configuration (`configure.in`, `Makefile.am`).
