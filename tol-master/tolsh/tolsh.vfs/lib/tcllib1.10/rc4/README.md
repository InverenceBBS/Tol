# README - rc4 Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `rc4` module from the Tcllib 1.10 library, part of the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides an implementation of the RC4 stream cipher encryption algorithm.

## Contents

### Files

- `rc4.tcl`: The main Tcl implementation of the RC4 algorithm.
- `rc4c.tcl`: Likely a related implementation or component (potentially C-bindings or a variant).
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to provide RC4 encryption capabilities within Tcl applications. It allows for the encryption and decryption of data streams using the RC4 algorithm.

*Note: RC4 is known to have security vulnerabilities and its use is generally discouraged in modern applications. Consider using more secure algorithms like AES.*
