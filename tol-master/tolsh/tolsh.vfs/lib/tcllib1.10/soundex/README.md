# README - soundex Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `soundex` module from Tcllib 1.10, part of the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides an implementation of the Soundex algorithm, a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English.

## Contents

### Files

- `soundex.tcl`: The core Tcl implementation of the Soundex algorithm.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to allow Tcl applications to compute the Soundex code for a given string (typically a name). Soundex codes can be used for searching or matching names that may have different spellings but similar pronunciations.
