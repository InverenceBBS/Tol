# Control Package

This directory contains the Tcllib `control` package, providing various control structure utilities.

## Files

*   `ascaller.tcl`: Procedures related to executing commands in the caller's context.
*   `assert.tcl`: Procedures for asserting conditions within code.
*   `control.tcl`: Likely the main package file or core utilities.
*   `do.tcl`: Provides loop constructs (`do ... while`, `do ... until`).
*   `no-op.tcl`: A command that does nothing (a no-operation).
*   `pkgIndex.tcl`: The package index file for loading `control`.
*   `tclIndex`: Standard Tcl index file.

## Usage

This package offers enhanced control flow mechanisms beyond standard Tcl commands.

```tcl
package require control

# Example Usage (Conceptual)

# Assertion
# control::assert {$x > 0} "x must be positive"

# Do-while loop
# set i 0
# control::do { puts $i; incr i } while {$i < 5}
```

Refer to the specific `.tcl` files or Tcllib documentation for detailed usage of each procedure.
