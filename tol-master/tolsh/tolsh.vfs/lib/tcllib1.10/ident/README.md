# README - ident Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `ident` module from Tcllib 1.10, within the `tolsh` VFS. This module implements the client and server side of the Identification Protocol (Ident, specified in RFC 1413), which is used to identify the user associated with a particular TCP connection.

## Contents

### Files

- `ident.tcl`: The core Tcl implementation for both Ident client queries and running an Ident server.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to provide Tcl applications with the ability to query remote Ident servers to determine the username associated with a connection originating from that server, or to run a local Ident server to respond to such queries. This protocol was historically used by services like IRC and FTP, but its use has declined due to privacy concerns and the ease of spoofing responses.
