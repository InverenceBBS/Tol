# OTAN TolTcl Linux 32-bit Build (`tol-master/toltcl/OTAN/ToltclLinux32/`)

## Overview

This directory contains resources specifically for the **OTAN build/packaging process** targeting **TolTcl for 32-bit Linux** environments.

## Contents

- **`ToltclLinux32.tol`:** A TOL language script (`.tol`) that likely implements the specific steps required to build or package the TolTcl binding for Linux 32-bit systems within the context of the OTAN build system (defined in `tol-master/toltcl/OTAN/_build.tol`).
- **`lib/`:** A subdirectory possibly containing pre-compiled 32-bit Linux libraries, helper scripts, or other resources needed exclusively for this build target.

## Purpose

This directory isolates the configuration and logic required for the OTAN build system to produce a 32-bit Linux version of the TolTcl binding.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** TOL scripting language.
- **Target Platform:** Linux 32-bit.
- **Context:** Part of the specialized OTAN build process.
