# README - asn Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `asn` module from Tcllib 1.10, part of the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides tools for encoding and decoding data using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), particularly the Basic Encoding Rules (BER).

## Contents

### Files

- `asn.tcl`: The core implementation for ASN.1 BER encoding and decoding.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to allow Tcl applications to process data encoded using ASN.1 BER. ASN.1 is a standard notation used to define data structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data, widely used in telecommunications and computer networking, notably in protocols like SNMP and LDAP, and in X.509 certificates.
