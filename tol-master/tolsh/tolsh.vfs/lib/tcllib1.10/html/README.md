# README - html Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `html` module from Tcllib 1.10, within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides procedures for generating HTML documents programmatically.

## Contents

### Files

- `html.tcl`: The core implementation containing procedures to generate HTML tags (e.g., `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<table>`).
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to simplify the creation of HTML documents from within Tcl scripts. Instead of manually concatenating strings containing HTML tags, developers can use procedures provided by this module to build the document structure in a more organized and less error-prone way. This is useful for CGI scripts, web application backends, or any Tcl program that needs to generate web content.
