# README - interp Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `interp` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module likely provides utilities related to managing and interacting with Tcl interpreters, possibly including slave interpreters or mechanisms for delegating command execution.

## Contents

### Files

- `interp.tcl`: Core procedures related to interpreter management or interaction.
- `deleg_method.tcl`: Procedures for delegating method calls between interpreters or objects across interpreter boundaries.
- `deleg_proc.tcl`: Procedures for delegating procedure (command) calls between interpreters.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module and its components.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to provide enhanced control over Tcl interpreters. This could include creating and managing slave interpreters, safely evaluating code in different interpreters, and facilitating communication or command delegation between them. This is useful for sandboxing, creating separate execution contexts, or building multi-threaded or multi-process Tcl applications.
