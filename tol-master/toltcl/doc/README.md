# TolTcl Documentation (`tol-master/toltcl/doc/`)

## Overview

This directory contains documentation specific to the **TolTcl** binding layer (`tol-master/toltcl/`), which connects the TOL engine with the Tcl scripting language.

## Contents

- **`toltcl.txt`:** A text file likely providing an overview, usage instructions, or API summary for the TolTcl binding itself. It might describe the Tcl commands provided by the binding (e.g., `tol::eval`, `tol::getvar`).
- **`toltableset.txt`:** A text file containing documentation focused on how TOL's `Table` and/or `Set` data types are represented and manipulated within the Tcl environment through the TolTcl binding. It might explain data conversion rules or specific Tcl commands for working with these types.

## Purpose

This directory provides targeted documentation for developers who need to understand how to use the TolTcl binding, either when developing Tcl-based applications that use TOL (like Tolbase) or when working on the TolTcl binding itself. It supplements the general TOL documentation found in `tol-master/doc/`.

## Appendix

- **Format:** Plain text files (`.txt`).
