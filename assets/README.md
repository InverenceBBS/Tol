# Documentation Assets (`assets/`)

## Overview

This folder stores shared images and other resources referenced throughout
TOL's documentation. Keeping them in one place ensures screenshots and logos
remain consistent across the various READMEs and guides.

## Contents

- `Tol_logo.png` â€“ the primary project logo used on introductory pages and
  in example screenshots.

## Purpose

Centralizing images prevents duplication and allows documentation to link to
a single location. If additional graphics are required, they should be placed
here so they can be reused by multiple documents.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** Static image assets (PNG).
- **Usage:** Refer to these files from other documentation using relative paths.
