# TolTcl Test Scripts (`tol-master/toltcl/tests/`)

## Overview

This directory contains automated test scripts for the **TolTcl** binding layer (`tol-master/toltcl/`).

## Contents

- **`tableset.tcl`:** A test script written in Tcl. This script specifically focuses on testing the TolTcl binding's ability to handle TOL's `Table` and `Set` data types. It likely performs actions such as:
    - Creating TOL Tables/Sets from Tcl data.
    - Passing Tcl data to TolTcl functions that expect Tables/Sets.
    - Receiving Table/Set results back from TOL into Tcl.
    - Manipulating TOL Tables/Sets using Tcl commands provided by the binding.
    - Asserting the correctness of data conversions and operations.

## Purpose

These tests verify the correct implementation of the data marshalling and manipulation logic within the TolTcl binding, particularly for the complex `Table` and `Set` types. Running this test helps ensure that data can be reliably exchanged between the Tcl environment and the TOL engine for these specific types. This test is likely executed as part of a larger test suite (perhaps triggered by scripts in `tol-master/tol_tests/`).

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** Tcl.
- **Focus:** Testing `Table` and `Set` handling in the TolTcl binding.
- **Usage:** Executed by a test runner script (e.g., `tol-master/tol_tests/run_all_tests.sh`) to verify TolTcl functionality.
