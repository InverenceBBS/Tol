Sign test

This test checks three hypotheses about the median of  the  given  sample.
The following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median is equal to the  given
      value)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median is  greater  than  or
      equal to the given value)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  median  is  less  than  or
      equal to the given value)

Requirements:
    * the scale of measurement should be ordinal, interval or ratio  (i.e.
      the test could not be applied to nominal variables).

The test is non-parametric and doesn't require distribution X to be normal

Input parameters:
    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N       -   size of the sample.
    Median  -   assumed median value.

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

While   calculating   p-values   high-precision   binomial    distribution
approximation is used, so significance levels have about 15 exact digits.
