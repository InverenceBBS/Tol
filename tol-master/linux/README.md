# Linux Utility Scripts (`tol-master/linux/`)

## Overview

This directory contains shell scripts and related libraries intended for use in a Linux environment, likely for managing or interacting with the TOL installation.

## Contents

- **`shflags`:** A copy of the `shFlags` shell library. `shFlags` provides a common framework for handling command-line flags and arguments within shell scripts (compatible with bash, dash, ksh, zsh). It allows developers to define flags, validate their types, and generate help messages easily.
- **`uptol`:** A shell script that likely utilizes the `shflags` library for parsing command-line options. Its name suggests it might be a utility for:
    - Updating an existing TOL installation.
    - Managing multiple TOL versions.
    - Performing other administrative or setup tasks related to TOL on Linux.

## Purpose

This directory provides command-line utilities to facilitate the management of TOL specifically on Linux systems. The inclusion of `shflags` indicates an effort to create robust and user-friendly command-line tools.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** Shell scripting (bash, sh, etc.), shFlags library.
- **Usage:** Command-line utilities for Linux users/administrators managing TOL installations.
