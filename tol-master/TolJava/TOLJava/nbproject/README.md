# NetBeans Project Files (`tol-master/TolJava/TOLJava/nbproject/`)

## Overview

This directory contains project configuration files specifically for the **NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**. These files are used by NetBeans to manage the `TolJava` Java API project located in the parent directory (`tol-master/TolJava/TOLJava/`).

## Contents

- **`project.xml`, `project.properties`:** Define project metadata, source/test directories, classpath, and other project-level settings recognized by NetBeans.
- **`build-impl.xml`:** Contains NetBeans-generated Ant build script logic, often extending the main `build.xml` in the parent directory.
- **`genfiles.properties`:** Properties related to generated files.
- **`private/`:** Contains user-specific NetBeans settings or metadata, which should generally not be committed to version control.

## Purpose

These files enable developers using the NetBeans IDE to easily open, build, run, and debug the core `TolJava` API project. They store the IDE-specific configuration needed for these tasks.

## Appendix

- **Technology:** NetBeans IDE project format, Apache Ant.
- **Usage:** Used automatically by the NetBeans IDE. Generally not modified manually unless customizing IDE behavior.
