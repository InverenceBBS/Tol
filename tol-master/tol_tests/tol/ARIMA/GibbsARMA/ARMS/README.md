# ARMS Tests (within GibbsARMA)

## Overview

This directory contains tests for a specific component or technique used within the Gibbs sampling estimation of ARMA models, possibly Adaptive Rejection Metropolis Sampling (ARMS).

## Contents

*   `ma.1.arms.tol`: A test script focusing on the MA(1) model (Moving Average of order 1) using the ARMS technique.

## Purpose

To verify the specific ARMS implementation, likely for sampling parameters or states within the MA(1) model context as part of a Gibbs sampler.
