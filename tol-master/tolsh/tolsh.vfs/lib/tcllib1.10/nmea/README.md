# README - nmea Module (tcllib 1.10)

## Overview

This directory contains the `nmea` module from Tcllib 1.10, located within the `tolsh` VFS. This module provides tools for parsing NMEA 0183 sentences, which are commonly used by GPS devices to transmit data.

## Contents

### Files

- `nmea.tcl`: The core implementation for parsing NMEA sentences.
- `pkgIndex.tcl`: Standard Tcl package index file for the module.

### Subdirectories

None.

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to allow Tcl applications to decode and interpret data received from GPS devices or other sources that use the NMEA 0183 standard protocol. It simplifies the process of extracting information like position, velocity, time, and satellite data from raw NMEA sentences.
