# TolSH Documentation (`tol-master/tolsh/doc/`)

## Overview

This directory contains documentation files related to the TolSH Starkit shell or potentially underlying protocols it uses.

## Contents

- **`TPA-first.odp`:** An OpenDocument Presentation file (`.odp`). The content is unclear, but "TPA" might refer to a specific architecture, protocol (Tol Protocol Architecture?), or component related to TolSH.
- **`protocol.txt`:** A text file describing a communication protocol. This might relate to how TolSH interacts with a remote TOL instance or another service (potentially the "rmtps" service mentioned elsewhere).
- **`rmtps_client.txt`:** A brief text file providing notes or context for the `rmtps_client` Tcl library found in `tol-master/tolbase/lib/`.

## Purpose

This directory provides supplementary documentation, including presentations and protocol descriptions, for understanding specific aspects of TolSH or related communication mechanisms.

## Appendix

- **Formats:** OpenDocument Presentation (`.odp`), Plain Text (`.txt`).
