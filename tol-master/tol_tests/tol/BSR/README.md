# TOL BSR (Binary Sparse Representation?) Tests

## Overview

This directory contains a large number of test suites for the BSR (possibly Binary Sparse Representation or a similar sparse matrix/data format) functionality within TOL.

## Contents

*   `_tolTester.tol`: A test runner script specific to BSR tests.
*   `general/`: Directory for general BSR tests.
*   `test_01/` through `test_38/` (with gaps): Individual numbered test sets, each likely focusing on specific BSR operations or scenarios.

## Purpose

To comprehensively verify the creation, manipulation, querying, and mathematical operations involving TOL's BSR data structures. Given the number of tests, this appears to be a core and complex feature.
