# Tolbase Documentation Files (`tol-master/tolbase/doc/`)

## Overview

This directory contains informational files related to the Tolbase project.

## Contents

- **`AUTHORS`:** Lists the authors/contributors.
- **`COPYING`:** Contains the license information (likely GPL, same as Tolbase).
- **`NEWS`:** Contains release notes or recent changes.
- **`THANKS`:** Lists acknowledgements.

These files appear to be copies of the main informational files found in the parent `tol-master/tolbase/` directory. There does not seem to be specific Tolbase user or developer documentation located here. Refer to the main Tolbase `README` or the top-level `tol-master/doc/` directory for more comprehensive documentation.

## Purpose

This directory likely serves as a standard location expected by build systems (like Autotools) for documentation files or as a place where informational files are staged during the build or installation process.

## Appendix

- **Content:** Copies of standard project information files.
