# TolJava Examples Source Code (`tol-master/TolJava/TOLJava-Ejemplos/src/`)

## Overview

This directory contains the Java source code (`.java` files) for the **TolJava Examples** projects. These examples demonstrate how to use the core TolJava API (`tol-master/TolJava/TOLJava/`) to interact with the TOL engine from Java applications.

## Contents

- **`com/`:** The root of the Java package structure containing the `.java` source files for the examples. These likely cover various aspects of TolJava usage, such as:
    - Initializing the interpreter.
    - Executing TOL code.
    - Passing data between Java and TOL (primitives, matrices, series, etc.).
    - Handling results and errors.
- **`toljava-ejemplos.zip`:** An archive file possibly containing the same example source code or related resources.

## Purpose

This source code provides practical, runnable examples for developers learning to use the TolJava binding. They serve as templates and demonstrate common usage patterns for integrating TOL into Java applications.

## Appendix

- **Implementation Language:** Java.
- **Dependencies:** Requires the compiled `TolJava.jar` and the native JNI library.
- **Build:** Compiled using the Ant script (`build.xml`) in the parent directory (`tol-master/TolJava/TOLJava-Ejemplos/`).
