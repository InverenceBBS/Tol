# TOL Project Documentation (`tol-master/doc/`)

## Overview

This directory serves as the central repository for documentation related to the **TOL (Time-Oriented Language)** project. It contains various documents covering different aspects of the language, its implementation, and usage.

## Content Structure

The documentation is organized into subdirectories based on topic:
- **`bugzilla/`:** Contains information related to bug tracking, possibly integration with a Bugzilla instance, or guidelines for reporting bugs.
- **`general/`:** Holds general documentation about the TOL project, its goals, history, overall architecture, or user guides not specific to a single component.
- **`kernel/`:** Provides documentation focused on the internal workings of the TOL interpreter core (the C++ engine found in `tol-master/tol/` and `tol-master/tol/btol/`). This might include design documents, explanations of data structures, or details on the evaluation mechanism.
- **`modeling/`:** Contains guides, tutorials, or examples related to performing statistical modeling, time series analysis, or other quantitative tasks using the TOL language and its standard library.
- **`performance/`:** Includes documents discussing the performance characteristics of TOL, benchmarking results, or tips for writing efficient TOL code.

(Note: The specific file formats within these directories are not listed here but could include text files, LaTeX documents, HTML, Markdown, diagrams, etc.)

## Potential API Functionality
